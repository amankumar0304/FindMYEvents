# FindMYEvents
This is a react app which allows a user to view events in his/her area and also allows them to create or delete new Events. React has been used to develop the app. Context API has been used. Fake rest API with json server locally on my machine and used that in the project.  Bootstrap has been used for styling and to accelerate the development.
